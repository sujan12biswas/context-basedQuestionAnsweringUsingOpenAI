    "Question": "I'm stuck on the CSR generation step for PayVantage integration. Any tips on how to proceed?",
    "Answer": "Steps to generate a CSR file for PayVantage integration are as follows:\\nPlease find the below steps to prepare CSR and validate steps. \\n\\n===================== \\nCSR Creation \\n=====================\\nSteps to be followed at client side: \\n(The below two steps to be performed and share csr with AXIS team, AXIS team will sign the given csr and revert to client)\\n\\n1) Generate a key\\nopenssl genrsa -aes128 -out [CLIENT_DOMAINNAME].key 2048\\n\\n2)Generate a CSR\\nopenssl req -new -key [CLIENT_DOMAINNAME].key -out [CLIENT_DOMAINNAME].csr\\n\\nNOTE: Keep the key file and password for key File Safe\\n\\n3) Validate the CRT (Once AXIS team shared signed certficate)\\nopenssl x509 -in <<AXIS_SIGNED_certfile.crt>>  -text -noout\\n\\nNote: In above step , paste the path of the signed certificate we shared with you,  in place of <<AXIS_SIGNED_certfile.crt>>\\n\\n4) Create the pkcs12 keystore\\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -out CLIENT_DOMAINNAME.p12 -inkey [CLIENT_DOMAINNAME].key  -in <<AXIS_SIGNED_certfile.crt>> -name <<aliasname>>    -certfile SakshamAPIClientRootCert.crt -certfile SakshamAPIClientIntermediateCertificate.crt\\nNote: Axis Team will share Saksham Root and Intermediate public certificates with client.\\n\\nEx: openssl pkcs12 -export -out axis.p12 -inkey Private.key -in  AXIS-client-certificate.crt -name AXIS -certfile Root.crt -certfile Intermediate.crt\\n\\nIn Step 3: Important step\\n\\nIn place of [CLIENT_DOMAINNAME].key , need to pass the path of the key file that was generated at the time of creating csr\\n\\nIn place of <<AXIS_SIGNED_certfile.crt>>, need to pass the path of the signed certificate that we shared to you.\\n\\nIn place of <<aliasname>> , you can give any name ( most clients prefer to give organisation name )\\n\\nand path of the Intermediate and root certificates given to you should be given in place of /SakshamAPIClientRootCert.crt -certfile ../SakshamAPIClientIntermediateCertificate.crt\\n\\nAfter passing everything correctly, click enter\\ni) It will ask for pass phrase for key file that you created while creating csr\\nii) Give password correctly which you gave while creating that key file\\nafter that, if you click enter\\niii) It will ask as enter export password, give a well-remembered password.\\niv) It will ask again to confirm same, enter same password again\\n\\nNow, pkcs12 will be generated.\\nThis file will be used to authenticate at axis bank side and if successful then you will be able consume the APIs you are subscribed for.\\n\\n===================== \\nAXIS team shared signed certificate matches private key =====================\\n\\nYou can check if an SSL certificate matches a Private Key by using the 3 easy commands below.\\n\\nFor your SSL certificate: openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in <file>.crt | openssl md5\\n\\nFor your RSA private key: openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in <file>.key | openssl md5\\n\\nFor your CSR: openssl req -noout -modulus -in <file>.csr | openssl md5\\n\\nYou just need to replace <file> with your file name. If all the three matches, the SSL certificate matches the Private Key.\\n\\nIncase if you need to convert .p12 File to .pem \\nopenssl pkcs12 -in CLIENT_DOMAINNAME.p12 -out CLIENT_DOMAINNAME.pem -nodes\\n\\n=======================\\nRemoving passphrase from private key\\n=======================\\nopenssl rsa -in [original.key] -out [new.key]",
